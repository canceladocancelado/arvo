# Arvo Pärt - Fratres

This example showcases the following **arvo** modules:

* **minimalism** for creating the additive process
* **transformations** for scalar transposition and inversion
* **tintinnabuli** for generating the tintinabuli

The python script also contains many standard music21 functions to construct the entire piano part including the pedal point and the 2-bar interludes between the melodic sections. It is thus a bit longer, but I wanted to reproduce the piano part as closely as possible.

The generated piece differs very slightly from Arvo Pärt's manuscript in a few instances, notably the tininnabuli line. Indeed, even if the vast majority of the t-voice is strictly in second position below the melody, Pärt "cheats" in a few places to create a better sonority or for reasons of musical direction.
