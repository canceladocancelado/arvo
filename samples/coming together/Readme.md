# Frederic Rzewski - Coming Together

This example showcases the following **arvo** modules:

* **minimalism** for creating the additive and substractive processes
* **transformations** for scalar transposition and inversion, as well as retrograde
* **scales** for the PentatonicScale subclass.

Since Rzewski applied mathematical processes in a very strict way to create the piece, the generated output is 100% identical to the original score.
