# arvo
A python library for procedural music composition, based on the music21 (https://github.com/cuthbertLab/music21) framework, created and maintained by Dr. Georges Dimitrov, composition professor at Concordia University (https://www.concordia.ca/finearts/music.html).

### Modules
This library currently contains the following core modules:

* **minimalism**: Functions for generating Philip Glass/Steve Reich-inspired additive and substractive processes.
* **transformations**: Functions for doing scalar transpositions and inversions, retrogrades...
* **tintinnabuli**: Functions for generating Arvo PÃ¤rt-inspired tintinnabuli.
* **isorhythm**: Functions for generating isorhythmic constructions from pitch and rhythm sequences.

It also contains the following helper modules:
* **sequences**: Useful integer sequences for music composition, like primes, fibonacci, kolakoski...
* **scales**: Extension of music21 scales system with some common/useful scales.
* **tools**: Convenient helper functions for quickly manipulating and combining music21 elements.
